# WTF

I am not sure what I installed in the last 48 hours, on my Gentoo system, but my ZendStudio "Welcome" screen is working again.

Yes, I know, why not use VIM, or Atom, or Brackets...

I don't even know anymore, I guess Ijust got used to it in my current day job that I don't know beter anymore :)

Did I mention Zend-Expressive? Great... I guess I have to deliver now...
