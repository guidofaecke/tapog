# WTF

I am not sure what I installed in the last 48 hours, on my Gentoo system, but my ZendStudio "Welcome" screen is working again.

Yes, I know, why not use VIM, or Atom, or Brackets...

I don't even know anymore, I guess Ijust got used to it in my current day job that I don't know beter anymore :)

Did I mention Zend-Expressive? Great... I guess I have to deliver now...

I was thinking about Doctrine at that point, however, it might be overkill, since I can't even decide on the storage engine at thst point


# However
I want to point out some good and influencel people that screwed up my coding style and thinking...

- Marco - aka. Ocramius - https://github.com/Ocramius - You are nuts!
